This folder contains a few bash scripts that I found helpful when downloading the IllustrisTNG data. 
Alternatively, it can be copied from the rental storage, where it is found as TNG100-1. 

A more comprehensive and robust explanation of data downloading can be found at the [(TNG Website)](https://www.tng-project.org/data/docs/scripts/)
